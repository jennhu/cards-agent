# cards-agent

Plays the card game with lots of user-specified options! **This README is a work in progress and will be updated frequently.**

## Usage
To get started, run `python play.py -h` to see a full list of options. You will see the following:

`play.py [-h] [-v] [-a {human,base,sarsa}] [-p P] [-N N] [-o OUT]`

By default, `-v = False`, `-a = 'human'`, `-p = 0.75`, `-N = 1`, and `-o = None`.
